App for organizing and sharing shoes with other users.

3 - For this app I used a mixture of a few types of technologies Javascript, CSS, Mongoose, Heroku, 7 restful routes, CRUD and express.

I used Javascript scriptlets <% %> to be able to apply javascript directly to my html.

Applied CSS to style the page.

Applied Mongoose Atlas to be able to deploy the site to Heroku so that the site is available from anywhere.

4 - To create the app I began by using the 7 restful routes to set up my create, read, update and delete routes (CRUD). Once getting the crud working i began to work on CSS for each route. Just to make sure everything looked the way I wanted it to. After completing the CSS i wanted to create users so that each individual could have their own closet for their shoes. After setting up the shoes i had to set rules using scriptlets so that the shoes would not show for every user.

5 - Issues I encountered were simple issues usually were simple typing errors, s where their shouldn't have been a s or naming variables different in the Schema and not calling it that in the POST route form. These gave major headaches due to not gettin errors so it was hard to find.

Figuring out how to post the information i currently had to the timeline route was difficult to figure out. Kaylee was a great help explaining how to use the form with a type of hidden in order to get the information to push over to the timeline page.

6 - In the future I want to add functionality through javascript that would allow a user to see the total value of their closet when they are logged in and in their closet page. I would also like to add a button that allows users to accumulate likes on their shoes.
